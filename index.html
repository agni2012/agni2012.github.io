He has a beret but forgot to wear it (weret).<br>
He swings from the trees in a clumsy display,<br>
An unintelligent primate just fumbling away.<br>

He stares at the sky with his mouth open wide,<br>
Confused by the clouds as they slowly glide.<br>
Bananas confound him; he chews on the peel,<br>
Garret the ferret just keeps it surreal.<br>

His friends try to teach him, but what can they do?<br>
Garret thinks "math" is a type of bamboo.<br>
Yet somehow, he’s happy, content with his fate,<br>
A carrot-like ferret who’s second to great! <br><br>-definetly me agni not chatGPT<br><br>im bored. lemme make a game (sorry its not here im still making it probly maybe not tho)`
